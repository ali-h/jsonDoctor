# jsonDoctor
A tool to broadcast and stream incoming custom_json transactions on Hive Blockchain

Front-end that can be used to broadcast any valid JSON on the blockchain with active/posting authority.

You can use it with Hive Keychain or entering your private key (not suggested). It also has some JSON templates to play with which includes hive-engine and blog operations (follow/unfollow).

This can also act like your gateway to interact with 2nd layers when a certain front-end is down or not accessible. For Example Transferring Hive-Engine tokens.

It has a very self defining developer theme which makes it easy to use.

There are also some options like changing the Auth type & RPC endpoint. It has a Log window that logs every change and transaction status.

It is helpful when testing a script that streams blockchain for specific custom JSONs, it helps avoid writing and running a separate script to broadcast.

If you've got something to include please fork the GitHub repository and open a PR. Thanks a lot! Feedback is appreciated.
